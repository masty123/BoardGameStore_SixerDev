## Starting idea
- You wanted to play some board games with your friends.
- You can’t seem to find any place or website in   
 Thailand that have the board game you wanted.
- In the end, You have to cancel the party at your  
 house because You can’t find that game.

Shouldn’t board game in Thailand be popular and easy to find right now like other foreign countries?

## Our purpose
We wanted to build the high quality website that sells board game that suits customer needs.
